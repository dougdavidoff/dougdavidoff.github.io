            <p>Doug Davidoff has been a newspaper reporter and a public relations consultant. But before all that (and there was <em>a great deal</em> of "all that"), he was interested in computers and coding.</p>
            <p>During junior high school in the 1970s, he worked on a teletypewriter terminal connected by an acoustic telephone coupler to the town school office's mainframe computer. He learned to play in BASIC and FORTRAN. During college, he worked with 80-column computer punch cards in the days when students submitted decks of cards and waited hours for the output to arrive on big printer forms.</p>
            <p>He was offered a chance to become a computer science major.</p>
            <p>Instead, he bacame a history major. Thus, a career direction was formed.<p>
            <p>This class is an opportunity to redirect that trijectory. So, Doug is a wordsmith who is training to become a codesmith.</p>
