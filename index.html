                    <p>Doug Davidoff has been a newspaper reporter and a public relations consultant for private business, state government, and statewide political campaigns. He delights in blogging, social media, and newswriting. He also delights in software coding.</p>                    <p>But before all that (and of "all that," there was a great amount over the years), Doug was interested in computers and coding.</p>
                    <p>During junior high school in the 1970s, Doug worked on a teletypewriter terminal connected by an acoustic telephone coupler to the school district's mainframe computer. He learned to play in BASIC and FORTRAN. During college, he worked with 80-column computer punch cards in the days when students submitted decks of cards and waited hours for the output to arrive on big printer forms.</p>
                    <p>Doug was recruited to become a computer science major.</p>
                    <p>Instead, he bacame a history major. Thus, a career direction was formed.</p>
                    <p>This class is an opportunity to redirect that trijectory. So, Doug is a wordsmith who is training to become a codesmith.</p>
